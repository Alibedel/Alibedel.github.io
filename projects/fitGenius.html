                The Workout Tracker application is an exciting project that helps users create, track and maintain their workout routines, diet, and progress. With this application, users can create, edit, and delete workouts, add new routines and diets, and upload photos to visually track their progress.

The project was developed using Python, Django, and SQL through Postgres. RESTful architecture principles were followed to ensure the application is robust, scalable and can handle large amounts of data.

Upon starting the application, users will be brought to the main page where they can see the tables that display their workout and diet information. Before logging in with the regular login features, users can sign up for a new account by clicking on the sign-up button in the nav bar. Once logged in, users will be brought to an index view of all their workouts, and they can view details, edit or delete workouts.

To create a new workout, users can click on the "New Workout" button on the navigation bar, which will take them to a page where they can add workout name and date. After clicking on the "Add Workout" button, they will be redirected to the index view. From there, they can click on the workout name and be redirected to the workout details page.

On the workout details page, users can view the workout name and date and add routines and diets. They can also edit or delete workouts and all other associated information such as diets, routines, and photos. Users can add routines to the workout page by entering the name, number of sets, and reps of that routine in the form provided. Similarly, they can add diets by entering the name and number of grams of the food they are consuming. Once the information is entered and the "Add Routine/Diet" button is clicked, it will be shown below the form.

At the bottom of the workout details page, there is an option to upload a photo of oneself using the AWS feature. This is a great feature that allows users to have a visual representation of their progress as they go through their fitness journey.

Overall, the Workout Tracker is an excellent example of a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that demonstrates the power of modern web development technologies. It is an excellent resource for anyone who wants to stay on track with their fitness journey and have an easy way to track their progress.
